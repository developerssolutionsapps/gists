# Beba App Development

## What really is Beba?

> Beba is a proposed transportation system designed to streamline and enhance the passenger and driver experience within the transportation industry. The platform offers a wide range of features for both passengers and drivers, ranging from account management and trip history to real-time booking and navigation services. Passengers can conveniently search for available buses, select their preferred seats, and even make secure payments through integrated third-party systems. Additionally, Beba ensures transparency and ease of use with functionalities such as detailed booking histories and downloadable invoices. For drivers, the application provides tools for managing trips, tracking routes, and maintaining essential documents. Beba stands out for its user-friendly interface, facilitating interactions between passengers and drivers while offering a range of essential features to optimize the travel experience for all parties involved.

## Beba App Development

> The Beba app is on the brink of offering a reliable and adaptable travel solution for all users. We're proud to share that we've successfully developed the Beba app using a clean architecture approach, ensuring that it's not only user-friendly but also easy to maintain and flexible for future expansions. As a team of developers we were dedicated to create a seamless platform that caters to both passengers and drivers. We've designed screens for features like booking, seat selection, and payment processing. We also implemented a back-end infrastructure with a server and database. Integrating external services, such as payment gateways and maps, hosting the server and deploying the application was some of the few significant steps that remains to be developed. 

## Termination of the beba application development

> We had challenges while developing the application. Communication gaps between us and the client, delayed client responses, hindered progress. Additionally, crucial resources like an images server, payment integration services (including Daraja for Mpesa), Google Maps access, and server hosting were lacking. With these challenges and the inability to overcome them, we've regrettably decided to cease the project. We appreciate the opportunity to work together and apologize for any inconvenience caused. The application can still be continued in future only under new terms and agreement.
